# Algorithms and Data Structures in Golang

This is a collection of basic algorithms and datastructures written in Golang. The idea behind this project
was to challenge myself to write alogrithms in a language that I am very unfamiliar with. Golang was chosen
because it is simple to read, yet offers the challenge of languages like c++ ( no dynamic array resizing, pointers, static type system etc ) which would add to the challenge of creating these algorithms. I also set myself the goal of writing these algorithms as cleanly as possible, I wanted to make sure anyone studying programming no matter how new would be able to understand how these algorithms work.
